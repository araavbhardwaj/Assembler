An assembler is a programming tool used to convert assembly language code into machine code, which is the low-level binary representation that can be executed by a computer's processor. The assembler performs this conversion by translating mnemonic instructions and their operands into their corresponding binary representations.

To choose an assembler for a specific Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), you need to consider the architecture of the target processor or microcontroller. Different ISAs have their own unique assembly language syntax and instruction formats.
